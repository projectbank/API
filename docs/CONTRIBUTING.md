# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the API! The API is meant to make the project easier for all of the parties involved. It should do all of the communication between the bank and the database. This ensures that it is impossible to commit fraud.

Please be aware of the fact that the contribution to this API is all voluntarily. Therefore, we expect you to be nice to everyone involved.

## Reporting bugs

If you have found a bug, we see forward to your bug report. This is only a small report so we can work on it. You don't have to develop a solution. To create a bug report, please create a new issue with the following information:

1. **What went wrong?** Did the API crash, did it give a false error or were you able to hack it?
2. **How can we recreate it?** What did you do to create this situation? We would like as much information as possible. If you have done additional research, we would like this too, of course. For example: if you have tested something multiple times and it went wrong once, we would also like to know what you tested successfully.

Thank you in advance for your detailed report! This makes our work so much easier.

## Contributing code

It is so awesome that you have written code! Of course we love to merge your code into our repository. However, to do this, there are a few requirements that have to be met. Please make sure of the following:

1. **Your code has to be documented.** We are very sorry, but we are not going to merge code that can't be maintained easily.
2. **Your code has to add something to the API.** If your code does not add something useful, we will not add it. This would make the codebase unnecessarily long.
3. **If you've worked on an issue, please note.** It would be best if you would reference the issue number in one of your commits, because that automatically links the issue and your PR. If you haven't done that, please at least name the issue that you have worked on.
4. **Label your PR.** This one can be done easily. Just label what you have done: fixed a bug, added a new function, etc.

## Documentation

If you have purely written documentation, you should know that you are the hero of our society. However, that is not what this repository is for. Yet. We still want all of the documentation, of course. Just not here.

All of the documentation can be merged with the existing repository for that: https://github.com/projectbank/Documentatie

## Thank you!

Thank you so much for wanting to contribute, and we are looking forward to see your contribution!
